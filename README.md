## 📌 Overview

**iClass** is a web-based classroom search and reservation system for the Engineering Building at San José State University. It allows users to view classroom availability, browse schedules, create accounts, reserve rooms, and submit complaints.

## 📝 Description

In iClass, our goal is to allow the students of SJSU the opportunity to find more accessible study spaces. The Student Union and MLK Library can get extremely crowded and inconvenient for a place to study, but it can be inappropriate to enter classrooms as classes may occur at any time.

This is where we come in. We at iClass have sourced publicly available data on classroom schedules to present students and faculty at SJSU with the ability to find available classrooms and "reserve" them. This increases productivity, reduces stress, and allows coordination between students on where they book their rooms.

There is an additional layer of security in that only those with an official .sjsu domain email address may reserve rooms, so faculty can view who has booked rooms at certain times if needed.

iClass also includes a complaints tab that allows users to report issues such as occupied rooms, scheduling conflicts, or misuse of the reservation system.

**Disclaimer:** The publicly sourced information does not include every classroom or every time slot. If a room is occupied, it is up to the user's discretion to leave, especially if an official SJSU activity is taking place. Abuse of this system may result in bans, complaints being filed, and potential reporting to SJSU.

```powershell
$env:MAIL_USER="your_email@gmail.com"
$env:MAIL_PASS="your_app_password"
$env:BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080"
```
If you are testing email confirmation from outside your local machine using Cloudflare Tunnel, replace **BASE_URL** with your public tunnel URL.
